# Machine Learning Project: Airline Price Predictor

## Overview

This project aims to predict airline ticket prices using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used includes various features such as the airline, source, destination, departure time, arrival time, duration, and the total stops. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts the price of a ticket based on these features.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `ProjectCode.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `EE5253_2023_Presentation_Group35.pptx`: A presentation file summarizing the project, methodology, and results.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up and run it.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airline-price-predictor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd airline-price-predictor
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ProjectCode.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code. The notebook includes steps for:

   - Loading and exploring the dataset
   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Training machine learning models
   - Evaluating the models' performance

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand its structure and features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might help improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.

## Results

The best-performing model in this project was a Random Forest Regressor, which achieved a mean absolute error of approximately X on the test set. The model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation and other relevant metrics to ensure its robustness and generalizability.
